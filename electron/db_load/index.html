    <p>
      What does apple photos think about you? Attach your apple photos library
      to see more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Photo Library has been automatically selected for you if available. To
      pick a specific library, click "Select Library".
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> this program will not work unless you have
      <em>named</em> faces in your apple photos library.
    </p>

    <p>
      To check this, go to Photos -> People and Pets and make sure you name
      <b>all</b> the faces you want to get stats about. If you have any issues,
      DM me!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> I have had some weird issues im currently debugging where
      sometimes it will bug out the report will not fully load the db. If this
      happens, a simply restart of the app fixes it. Hopefully should be fixed
      soon.
